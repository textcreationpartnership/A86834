         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners cannot but with all thankfulnesse acknowledge the great goodnesse of God in casting our Lot in a free Nation, wherein so high and honourable a Court as a Parliament, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb facs="tcp:160353:3"/>to interpose betweene the people and all tyranny and oppression, and the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manifestation of this goodness, in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together this Parliament in a time of such imminent danger of the losse of all the subjects liberties, and likewise wee cannot but be sensible of the special concurrence of the divine power with your counsels, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and Agents, whereby many grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were redressed, burthens removed, &amp; the decayes of our Nation began to be repaired, and the hearts of all the well-affected filled with large hopes of beholding againe the glory of the free-born English Nation. but with griefe of heart wee are constrained to declare to this honourable Court, that our living hopes begin to fade, and are almost exchanged into dying feares, while we sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the same coruptions in the courts of Judicature still remaining, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have for many yeares groaned under, the displacing of many men (of known fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in their engagements for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Subject liberties) out of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the great City of our Kingdome, and
<pb facs="tcp:160353:3"/>the under-mining the fundamentall liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Nation, by discouraging of the free Commons of England, from presenting in the most humble way their grievances; All which we humbly conceive to proceed from some Members sitting in this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable house, against whom the free Commons of England have not had liberty to bring in their aconsations and charges. Wherefore, while we are groaning under afflicting fears that the sad apprehensions of these growing miseries should so foment Jealousies in the peoples hearts, that the old designe against the Kingdomes liberties is now acted and managed in a new forme, that thereby the distractions of the Kingdome should bee augmented, and the Subjects prevented of their enjoyment of a safe, well-grounded, &amp; long-expected peace. Wee cannot but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly implore this honourable house.</p>
            <p>That the corruptions in the Courts of judicature, might bee speedily considered by this Honourable House, that the places of trust in our yet distracted Kingdome might bee committed to those who have faithfully interested themselves in the common cause of preserving the Subjects liberties.
